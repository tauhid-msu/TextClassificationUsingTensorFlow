In this project, I implemented a text classifier for the BBC dataset using TensorFlow library. Thes dataset contains articles that are classified into a number of different categories. I used Keras text tokenizer technique for sub-words in the articles.  The fixed length vectors are then trained through a Convolution Neural Network along with text emdedding. Training accuracy reached 96% while validation accuracy was approximately 88%.
